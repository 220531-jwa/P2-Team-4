# :airplane:Air Travel Ticketing/Tracking System:airplane:

## Purpose

An airport wishes to provide a better system put in place that’ll encourage more people to fly with them. As of right now the current system only allows for travelers to buy a ticket and not provide viable information that’s detrimental to their travel. To provide better services to their customers the airport is asking that a system be developed not only to buy tickets, but to give individuals that fly with them information about their flight arrival and departure. It will also be able to have a user be able to login with their credentials and recommend different flights based on their previous flights purchased.
